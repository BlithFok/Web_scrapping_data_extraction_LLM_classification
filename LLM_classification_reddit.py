# use LLM to classify reddit posts based on the degree of illness: severe illness, light illness and no illness

# this program is designed so that the occurence of exceeding token per minute error can be elimitated

# the program will try to use the faster gpt-3.5-turbo, but automically switch to gpt-4 when the input tokens are too much. The output is specified to match a specific pattern
